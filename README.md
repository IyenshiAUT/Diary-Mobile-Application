  <p>A considerable number of people are dying a year due to strokes because many of them have not any idea whether they are like to face this condition. So the model that we have implemented can be used in health sectors for predicting whether a person is going to have a stroke and if the result is possible they can take necessary actions to prevent from having a stroke. Here we have used two model using the algorithms Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, and the performance has been compared in order to select one in health sector.</p>
